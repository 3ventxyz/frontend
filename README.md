# 3vent Frontend Repository 

## Getting Started

- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Dependency Management

- `yarn add` to install packages
- never use NPM, we shouldn't have a `package-lock.json` file
